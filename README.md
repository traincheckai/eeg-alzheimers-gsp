# Alzheimer's Detection in EEG via GSP and Machine Learning

Welcome to our GitHub repository dedicated to advancing Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection using state-of-the-art Graph Signal Processing (GSP) and Machine Learning techniques. Here's what you'll find in this repository:

## Repository Contents
- **Comprehensive Notebook**: A detailed Jupyter notebook that applies innovative GSP techniques for AD detection, leveraging EEG data analysis.
- **Cutting-edge Methodology**: Our approach integrates Graph Discrete Fourier Transform (GDFT) with robust machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, focusing on precise and effective AD detection.
- **Rich Dataset Analysis**: Examination of publicly accessible EEG data from 88 individuals, categorized into three groups: Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), and Healthy Controls (HC).

## Key Results
- **Binary Classification Performance**: Attained an impressive 85% accuracy in distinguishing dementia from HC using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.
- **Multiclass Classification Achievement**: Reached a 44% accuracy in differentiating between AD, FTD, and HC using the Naive Bayes model.

## Innovations and Contributions
- **Novel GSP Approach**: Introduction of a unique GSP methodology, marking a significant step forward in AD detection.
- **Framework for Future Research**: Lays the groundwork for applying GSP in broader neurodegenerative disease research, opening doors to numerous possibilities.

## Future Directions
- **Expanding Horizons**: Our methodology has potential applications in exploring a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Major Depressive Disorder, Epilepsy, and Parkinson's Disease, particularly in the context of diverse neuroimaging data.
